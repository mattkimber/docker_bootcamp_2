# Docker Bootcamp 2

This repository contains container image definitions for the Docker Bootcamp session
on mount points and persistent state.

It consists of a simple CRUD app allowing the user to upload photos, in two different
versions to illustrate container upgrading concepts.

This is probably not too useful outside the training, although you may wish to use
the files as the basis for a simple Express app and/or Node Dockerfile.
